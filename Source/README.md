## :rocket: RocketMan :rocket:  0.3.1 THE NEXT RUNTIME_GC

### What is RocketMan?
Used to improve stat performance by adding caching and adaptive caching to StatWorker and StatPart. Originally developed by NotooShabby and now reworked by Krkr. 

### TIPS
#### For the adaptive settings:
 -  Set combat stats to 0 ticks. 
 - Set comfort, stuff, beauty and temperature stats to the highest value possible. 
 - Set Workspeed, etc to a value in-between. 
 - Set Work to complete to 0. 
 - Use adaptive mod for 30 minute maximum.
